# GLang  
An interpreted, weakly typed, OOP programming language  
  
## What the project contains  
Right now, GLang consists only of a half-functioning lexer  
  
## Example syntax (Hello World program)  


>fn main() -> {  
>    print("Hello world!\n"); // This is a comment  
>    /* This is also a comment */  
>    return;  
>}
